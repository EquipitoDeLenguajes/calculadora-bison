# Bison Calculator.
## Instructions for use.

The following instructions should be followed if you have a linux distribution with a bash terminal.

You need to install bison (yacc) and flex (lex). In Debian distributions you can use:

```sh
sudo apt-get install bison
```

```sh
sudo apt-get install flex
```

### Option 1: Execute `run.sh` script

- Open a terminal and use the `cd` command to move to the folder where you saved the project files.

- Once in the project folder, execute `run.sh` script with the following line:

```sh
./run.sh
```

This sohuld start the calculator.

**Note**: If necessary, give execution permissions to `run.sh` with:

```sh
chmod +x run.sh
```

### Option 2: Compile the program manually:

#### 1. Run the following line to process the grammar definition file:

```sh
bison -d calculadora.y
```

This will generate 2 files:
- `calculadora.tab.c`: C code for the parser.
- `calculadora.tab.h`: Definitions of tokens used in the parsing.

#### 2. Run the following line to process the lexical analysis definition file:

```sh
flex calculadora.l
```

This will generate 1 file:
- `lex.yy.c` Contain the C code for the lexical analyzer based on the rules defined in `calculator.l`

#### 3. Run the following line to compile and link the code generated by Bison and Flex:

```sh
gcc calculadora.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl
```

This will generate an `a.out` file.

#### 4. Execute the `a.out` file with the next line:

```sh
./a.out
```

This sohuld start the calculator.
